/**
 * @title MorphoUsdsAdapter
 * @notice Adapter contract for migrating user positions from Morpho to Compound III (Comet), with support for USDS-based markets.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements the `IProtocolAdapter` interface and integrates the `SwapModule` and `ConvertModule`
 *      to facilitate seamless migration of debt and collateral positions. It supports token swaps via Uniswap V3
 *      and stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) for USDS-based Compound III markets.
 *
 * Core Responsibilities:
 * - Decodes user positions (borrows and collaterals) from encoded calldata.
 * - Handles repayment of variable-rate debt positions in Morpho.
 * - Executes token swaps or stablecoin conversions as needed for repayment or migration.
 * - Withdraws and optionally converts Morpho collateral tokens before supplying them to Compound III.
 * - Supports Uniswap-based flash loan repayments with fallback logic to pull funds from the user's Comet balance.
 *
 * USDS-Specific Logic:
 * - Converts DAI to USDS when migrating to USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Converts USDS to DAI when repaying flash loans borrowed in DAI for USDS Comet markets.
 * - Automatically detects when stablecoin conversion is required based on swap paths and base tokens.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - `executeMigration`: Entry point for coordinating the full migration flow.
 * - `_repayBorrow`: Handles repayment of Morpho debt, optionally performing swaps or conversions.
 * - `_migrateCollateral`: Withdraws and optionally converts Morpho collateral into Comet-compatible tokens.
 * - `_repayFlashloan`: Repays flash loans using contract balance or by withdrawing from the user's Comet account.
 * - `_isDebtCleared`: Verifies whether a specific Morpho debt position has been fully repaid.
 *
 * Constructor Configuration:
 * - Accepts Uniswap router, stablecoin converter, token addresses, Morpho contracts, and a full migration flag.
 * - Stores all parameters as immutable for gas efficiency and safety.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - User must approve this contract to transfer relevant collateral and debt positions.
 * - The user must grant permission to the Migrator contract to interact with their tokens in the target Compound III market:
 *   `IComet.allow(migratorV2.address, true)`.
 * - Underlying assets must be supported by Uniswap or have valid conversion paths via `ConvertModule`.
 * - Swap parameters must be accurate and safe (e.g., `amountInMaximum` and `amountOutMinimum`).
 * - If a flash loan is used, the `flashloanData` must be valid and sufficient to cover the loan repayment.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Supports only variable-rate Morpho debt.
 * - Only DAI ⇄ USDS conversions are supported for USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Relies on external swap/conversion modules and Comet's support for `withdrawFrom` and `supplyTo`.
 *
 * Warning:
 * - This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts.

     *
     * @dev This function performs the following steps:
     *  1. Retrieves the user's position and market parameters from the Morpho protocol.
     *  2. Determines the amount of collateral to migrate. If `assetsAmount` is set to `type(uint256).max`,
     *     it migrates the entire collateral balance.
     *  3. Calls `withdrawCollateral` to transfer the specified amount from the user to this contract.
     *  4. If a swap is required:
     *     - Converts DAI → USDS if applicable using `_convertDaiToUsds()`.
     *     - Otherwise, performs a Uniswap V3 swap defined by `swapParams`.
     *     - If the Comet base token is USDS but the output token is DAI, converts DAI → USDS.
     *  5. Supplies the resulting token (USDS, DAI, or other) to the Compound III market via `supplyTo()`.
     *  6. If no swap is needed, supplies the collateral directly to the Comet market.
     *
     * @param user The address of the user whose Morpho collateral is being migrated.
     * @param comet The address of the target Compound III (Comet) contract to receive the supplied asset.
     * @param collateral Struct containing:
     *        - `marketId`: The ID of the Morpho market from which to withdraw collateral.
     *        - `assetsAmount`: The amount to migrate (use `type(uint256).max` to migrate all).
     *        - `swapParams`: Parameters for performing optional swaps or conversions.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - The user must have sufficient collateral in the specified Morpho market.
     * - If a swap or conversion is required, enough token liquidity must be available.
     *
     * Effects:
     * - May trigger withdrawals from Morpho.
     * - May invoke Uniswap V3 swaps or DAI → USDS conversions.
     * - Supplies the resulting token to the Compound III market.
