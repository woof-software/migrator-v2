/**
 * @title AaveV3UsdsAdapter
 * @notice Adapter contract for migrating user positions from Aave V3 to Compound III (Comet), with support for USDS-based markets.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements the `IProtocolAdapter` interface and integrates the `SwapModule` and `ConvertModule`
 *      to facilitate seamless migration of debt and collateral positions. It supports token swaps via Uniswap V3
 *      and stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) for USDS-based Compound III markets.
 *
 * Core Responsibilities:
 * - Decodes user positions (borrows and collaterals) from encoded calldata.
 * - Handles repayment of variable-rate debt positions in Aave V3.
 * - Executes token swaps or stablecoin conversions as needed for repayment or migration.
 * - Withdraws and optionally converts Aave collateral tokens before supplying them to Compound III.
 * - Supports Uniswap-based flash loan repayments with fallback logic to pull funds from the user's Comet balance.
 *
 * USDS-Specific Logic:
 * - Converts DAI to USDS when migrating to USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Converts USDS to DAI when repaying flash loans borrowed in DAI for USDS Comet markets.
 * - Automatically detects when stablecoin conversion is required based on swap paths and base tokens.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - `executeMigration`: Entry point for coordinating the full migration flow.
 * - `_repayBorrow`: Handles repayment of Aave V3 debt, optionally performing swaps or conversions.
 * - `_migrateCollateral`: Withdraws and optionally converts Aave collateral into Comet-compatible tokens.
 * - `_repayFlashloan`: Repays flash loans using contract balance or by withdrawing from the user's Comet account.
 * - `_isDebtCleared`: Verifies whether a specific Aave V3 debt position has been fully repaid.
 *
 * Constructor Configuration:
 * - Accepts Uniswap router, stablecoin converter, token addresses, Aave contracts, and a full migration flag.
 * - Stores all parameters as immutable for gas efficiency and safety.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - User must approve this contract to transfer relevant aTokens and debtTokens.
 * - Underlying assets must be supported by Uniswap or have valid conversion paths via `ConvertModule`.
 * - Swap parameters must be accurate and safe (e.g., `amountInMaximum` and `amountOutMinimum`).
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Supports only variable-rate Aave debt (interestRateMode = 2).
 * - Only DAI ⇄ USDS conversions are supported for USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Relies on external swap/conversion modules and Comet's support for `withdrawFrom` and `supplyTo`.
 *
 * Warning:
 * - This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts.

     * @param borrow Struct describing the debt position, including:
     *        - `debtToken`: Address of the Aave V3 variable debt token to be repaid.
     *        - `amount`: Amount of debt to repay. If set to `type(uint256).max`, repays full debt balance.
     *        - `swapParams`: Optional swap parameters to acquire `debtToken` (exact output swap or conversion).
     *
     * Swap Logic:
     * - If `swapParams.path.length > 0`, a swap is required.
     * - If the path implies DAI → USDS, `_convertDaiToUsds()` is invoked directly.
     * - If the path implies USDS → DAI, `_convertUsdsToDai()` is invoked directly.
     * - Otherwise, a Uniswap V3 swap is performed using `ExactOutputParams`.
     *
     * Repayment:
     * - The function extracts the underlying token of the `debtToken`.
     * - Approves the Aave LendingPool to spend `repayAmount`.
     * - Calls `repay()` on Aave with the user as the beneficiary.
     *
     * Post-checks:
     * - If `IS_FULL_MIGRATION` is true and residual debt remains, reverts with `DebtNotCleared`.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - The user must have sufficient allowance or supply for debt repayment.
     * - If a swap is performed, the swap path and `amountInMaximum` must be valid.
     *
     * Reverts:
     * - If the full debt is not cleared during full migration.
     * - If token transfers, swaps, or approvals fail.

     * @notice Migrates a user's collateral position from Aave V3 to Compound III (Comet).
     *
     * @dev This function handles collateral withdrawal from Aave, optional swap or conversion
     * into the desired token, and final deposit into the target Compound III market.
     *
     * Steps performed:
     * 1. Determines the amount of aToken to migrate. If `collateral.amount == type(uint256).max`,
     *    the user's entire aToken balance is used.
     * 2. Transfers aTokens from the user to the contract.
     * 3. Calls Aave V3 LendingPool to withdraw the corresponding underlying asset.
     * 4. Depending on the `swapParams`, the function performs:
     *    - No swap: directly supplies the asset to Compound III.
     *    - DAI → USDS conversion via `_convertDaiToUsds()`, if required by the Comet market.
     *    - Swap via Uniswap V3 using `ExactInputParams`, followed by optional USDS conversion.
     *
     * Special handling:
     * - If the target Compound III market uses USDS and the user has DAI collateral,
     *   the contract automatically converts DAI to USDS.
     * - If `swapParams.path.length > 0`, it performs an on-chain token swap before depositing.
     *
     * @param user The address of the user whose collateral is being migrated.
     * @param comet The address of the Compound III (Comet) market where the collateral will be deposited.
     * @param collateral Struct describing the collateral position, including:
     *        - `aToken`: Address of the Aave aToken to be migrated.
     *        - `amount`: Amount of aToken to migrate. Use `type(uint256).max` to migrate full balance.
     *        - `swapParams`: Parameters describing the swap route (Uniswap V3) and minimum output.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - The user must have approved this contract to transfer their aTokens.
     * - If a swap is required, the `path` must be correctly constructed.
     * - The Uniswap router must be set and operational for swap execution.
     *
     * Reverts:
     * - If swap fails or amountOut is below `amountOutMinimum`.
     * - If token transfers or approvals fail due to allowance issues.
