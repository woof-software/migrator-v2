/**
 * @title AaveV3UsdsAdapter
 * @notice Adapter contract for migrating user positions from Aave V3 into Compound III (Comet),
 *         with native support for USDS markets and stablecoin conversion.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements the `IProtocolAdapter` interface and is designed to be used via
 *      delegatecall from the `MigratorV2` contract. It facilitates the seamless transfer of debt
 *      and collateral positions from Aave V3 to Compound III, with extended functionality to
 *      support USDS-based markets through the `ConvertModule`.
 *
 *      Core Responsibilities:
 *      - Decodes the user’s position (borrows and collaterals) from encoded calldata.
 *      - Handles repayment of variable-rate debt positions in Aave V3.
 *      - Executes token swaps (via Uniswap V3) or stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) as needed.
 *      - Withdraws and optionally converts Aave V3 collateral tokens before supplying them to Comet.
 *      - Automatically wraps native tokens (ETH → WETH) when required.
 *      - Supports Uniswap-based flash loan repayments, with fallback logic to pull funds from the user’s Comet balance.
 *
 *      USDS-Specific Logic:
 *      - Converts DAI to USDS when migrating to USDS-based Comet markets.
 *      - Converts USDS to DAI when repaying flash loans borrowed in DAI for USDS Comet markets.
 *      - Automatically detects when stablecoin conversion is required based on swap paths and base tokens.
 *
 *      Key Components:
 *      - `executeMigration`: Entry point called via delegatecall from `MigratorV2`. Coordinates full migration flow.
 *      - `_repayBorrow`: Repays Aave V3 debt, optionally converting tokens or swapping to the debt token.
 *      - `_migrateCollateral`: Withdraws and optionally converts Aave collateral into Comet-compatible tokens.
 *      - `_repayFlashloan`: Repays flash loans using the contract’s balance or by pulling from the user’s Comet account.
 *      - `_isDebtCleared`: Checks whether a specific Aave debt position has been fully repaid (for full migrations).
 *
 *      Swap & Conversion Support:
 *      - Integrates `SwapModule` for Uniswap V3 exact input/output swaps.
 *      - Integrates `ConvertModule` for DAI ⇄ USDS conversions.
 *      - Automatically chooses between swap and conversion logic based on token path and base token.
 *
 *      Constructor Configuration:
 *      - Accepts Uniswap router, stablecoin converter, token addresses, Aave contracts, and a full migration flag.
 *      - Stores all parameters as immutable for gas efficiency and safety.
 *
 *      Reentrancy:
 *      - All external entry points are guarded by `DelegateReentrancyGuard` to ensure secure delegatecall execution.
 *
 *      Requirements:
 *      - User must have approved this contract to move relevant aTokens and debtTokens.
 *      - Underlying assets must be supported by Uniswap or have valid conversion paths via `ConvertModule`.
 *      - Swap parameters must be accurate and safe (especially for `amountInMaximum` and `amountOutMinimum`).
 *
 *      Limitations:
 *      - Supports only variable-rate Aave debt (interestRateMode = 2).
 *      - Only DAI ⇄ USDS conversions are supported (for USDS-based Comet markets).
 *      - Relies on external swap/conversion modules and Comet's support for `withdrawFrom` and `supplyTo`.
