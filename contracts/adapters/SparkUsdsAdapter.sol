/**
 * @title SparkUsdsAdapter
 * @notice Adapter contract for migrating user positions from Spark Protocol to Compound III (Comet), with support for USDS-based markets.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements the `IProtocolAdapter` interface and integrates the `SwapModule` and `ConvertModule`
 *      to facilitate seamless migration of debt and collateral positions. It supports token swaps via Uniswap V3
 *      and stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) for USDS-based Compound III markets.
 *
 * Core Responsibilities:
 * - Decodes user positions (borrows and collaterals) from encoded calldata.
 * - Handles repayment of variable-rate debt positions in Spark Protocol.
 * - Executes token swaps or stablecoin conversions as needed for repayment or migration.
 * - Withdraws and optionally converts Spark collateral tokens before supplying them to Compound III.
 * - Supports Uniswap-based flash loan repayments with fallback logic to pull funds from the user's Comet balance.
 *
 * USDS-Specific Logic:
 * - Converts DAI to USDS when migrating to USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Converts USDS to DAI when repaying flash loans borrowed in DAI for USDS Comet markets.
 * - Automatically detects when stablecoin conversion is required based on swap paths and base tokens.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - `executeMigration`: Entry point for coordinating the full migration flow.
 * - `_repayBorrow`: Handles repayment of Spark debt, optionally performing swaps or conversions.
 * - `_migrateCollateral`: Withdraws and optionally converts Spark collateral into Comet-compatible tokens.
 * - `_repayFlashloan`: Repays flash loans using contract balance or by withdrawing from the user's Comet account.
 * - `_isDebtCleared`: Verifies whether a specific Spark debt position has been fully repaid.
 *
 * Constructor Configuration:
 * - Accepts Uniswap router, stablecoin converter, token addresses, Spark contracts, and a full migration flag.
 * - Stores all parameters as immutable for gas efficiency and safety.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - User must approve this contract to transfer relevant spTokens and debtTokens.
 * - The user must grant permission to the Migrator contract to interact with their tokens in the target Compound III market:
 *   `IComet.allow(migratorV2.address, true)`.
 * - Underlying assets must be supported by Uniswap or have valid conversion paths via `ConvertModule`.
 * - Swap parameters must be accurate and safe (e.g., `amountInMaximum` and `amountOutMinimum`).
 * - If a flash loan is used, the `flashloanData` must be valid and sufficient to cover the loan repayment.

 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Supports only variable-rate Spark debt (interestRateMode = 2).
 * - Only DAI ⇄ USDS conversions are supported for USDS-based Comet markets.
 * - Relies on external swap/conversion modules and Comet's support for `withdrawFrom` and `supplyTo`.
 *
 * Warning:
 * - This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts.

     * - After acquiring the repayment token, the function approves the Spark Lending Pool to spend it
     *   and calls `repay()` on behalf of the user.
     *
     * If the migration mode is full (`IS_FULL_MIGRATION`), the function verifies that the debt has been
     * fully cleared using `_isDebtCleared()` and reverts with `DebtNotCleared()` if any residual debt remains.

     * @param user The address of the user whose Spark borrow position is being repaid.
     * @param borrow Struct containing:
     *        - `debtToken`: Address of the Spark variable debt token to repay.
     *        - `amount`: The amount of debt to repay. Use `type(uint256).max` for full repayment.
     *        - `swapParams`: Parameters to define token swap logic (optional).
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - If a swap is required, `swapParams.path` must be valid and match the expected input/output tokens.
     * - The user must hold sufficient Spark debt and allow repayment on their behalf.
     * - If in full migration mode, the debt must be fully cleared after repayment.
     *
     * Effects:
     * - Performs token conversion or swap if necessary.
     * - Transfers repayment tokens to the Spark Lending Pool.
     * - Verifies debt clearance post-repayment if `IS_FULL_MIGRATION` is set.
     *
     * Reverts:
     * - If the debt is not fully cleared during a full migration.
     * - If token transfers, swaps, or approvals fail.

     * @dev This function withdraws the specified collateral from Spark, optionally swaps it to a
     * supported token in the Comet market, and deposits it into the target Compound III market
     * on behalf of the user.
     *
     * Migration strategies supported:
     * - Full or partial migration of collateral.
     * - Direct supply of the underlying asset if no swap is needed.
     * - Token swap using Uniswap V3 for cases when the Spark collateral must be converted
     *   to a supported token in Compound III.
     * - USDS migration via DAI proxy mechanism:
     *     - If the swap result is DAI and the Compound market uses USDS as base token,
     *       DAI is converted to USDS before supply.
     *
     * @param user The address of the user whose collateral is being migrated.
     * @param comet The address of the Compound III (Comet) market to which the collateral is supplied.
     * @param collateral Struct describing the Spark collateral position:
     *        - `spToken`: The Spark spToken address representing the collateral.
     *        - `amount`: The amount of collateral to migrate (can be `type(uint256).max` for full).
     *        - `swapParams`: Optional parameters defining swap path and limits.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - The user must approve the contract to transfer their `spToken`.
     * - If `swapParams.path.length > 0`, it must be valid and executable.
     * - For DAI → USDS conversion, `ConvertModule` must be configured with valid converter.
     *
     * Effects:
     * - Transfers and withdraws collateral from Spark.
     * - Optionally swaps/unwraps/wraps/convert tokens to match Comet's requirements.
     * - Supplies resulting asset to Comet market on behalf of the user.
