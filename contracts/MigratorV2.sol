/**
 * @title MigratorV2
 * @notice Facilitates the migration of user positions from external lending protocols (e.g., Aave V3, Morpho, Spark)
 *         into Compound III (Comet), optionally using Uniswap V3 flash loans to cover liquidity gaps.
 *
 * @dev Supports protocol-specific migrations via modular adapters, which handle collateral withdrawal, debt repayment,
 *      and asset supply to the target Comet market. Flash loans are validated using precomputed hashes to ensure security.
 *      Integrates with `SwapModule` for Uniswap V3 swaps and `ConvertModule` for DAI ⇄ USDS conversions.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Modular adapter system for protocol-specific migration logic.
 * - Optional Uniswap V3 flash loans for liquidity management.
 * - Owner-controlled adapter registration and flash loan configuration.
 * - Supports stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) for USDS-based Comet markets.
 *
 * Core Flow:
 * 1. User initiates migration via `migrate()` with adapter, target Comet, migration data, and optional flash loan amount.
 * 2. If `flashAmount > 0`, a flash loan is requested, and `uniswapV3FlashCallback()` handles repayment and migration.
 * 3. If `flashAmount == 0`, migration is executed directly without borrowing.
 * 4. Emits `MigrationExecuted` upon success.
 *
 * Security:
 * - Only whitelisted adapters and configured Comet contracts are allowed.
 * - Flash loan callbacks are strictly validated by hash and sender address.
 * - Adapters must implement `IProtocolAdapter` and are executed via `delegatecall`.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Assumes adapter logic is secure and performs proper token accounting.
 * - Assumes flash loan repayment tokens are supported by Uniswap V3 and Comet.
 * - Relies on external modules (`SwapModule`, `ConvertModule`) for swaps and conversions.
 *
 * Warning:
 * - This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts.
