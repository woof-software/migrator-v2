/**
 * @title MigratorV2
 * @notice Facilitates the migration of user positions from external lending protocols into Compound III (Comet),
 *         using Uniswap V3 flash loans as optional liquidity to cover temporary shortfalls.
 *
 * @dev MigratorV2 is designed to be a generic migration orchestrator that supports multiple source protocols through
 *      a modular adapter system. Each adapter implements the logic necessary to withdraw collateral, repay debt, and
 *      supply the assets into the target Comet market on behalf of a user.
 *
 *      Key Features:
 *      - Supports protocol-specific migration via registered adapter contracts (e.g., SparkAdapter, MorphoAdapter).
 *      - Optionally leverages Uniswap V3 flash loans to cover liquidity gaps during migration.
 *      - Uses `delegatecall` to adapters, ensuring state context is preserved.
 *      - Enforces strict callback validation using precomputed hashes to prevent replay or spoofed callbacks.
 *      - Owner-controlled registration and configuration of supported adapters and Comet markets.
 *
 *      Core Flow:
 *      1. A user initiates migration via `migrate()` specifying:
 *         - The source protocol adapter
 *         - The target Comet market
 *         - Encoded migration data
 *         - Flash loan amount (optional)
 *      2. If `flashAmount > 0`, a flash loan is requested from the associated Uniswap V3 pool.
 *         On callback, `uniswapV3FlashCallback()` executes the migration via the adapter and ensures repayment.
 *      3. If `flashAmount == 0`, the migration is executed immediately without borrowing.
 *      4. Upon success, a `MigrationExecuted` event is emitted.
 *
 *      Security Considerations:
 *      - Only whitelisted adapters may be used.
 *      - Only configured Comet contracts with valid flash loan data may be targeted.
 *      - All Uniswap callbacks are strictly validated by hash and sender address.
 *      - Owner functions include pausing, adapter registration, and flash data configuration.
 *
 *      Limitations:
 *      - Assumes adapter logic is safe and performs proper token accounting.
 *      - Assumes flash loan repayment tokens are supported by Uniswap V3 and Comet.
