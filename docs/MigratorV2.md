## MigratorV2

Facilitates the migration of user positions from external lending protocols (e.g., Aave V3, Morpho, Spark)
        into Compound III (Comet), optionally using Uniswap V3 flash loans to cover liquidity gaps.

_Supports protocol-specific migrations via modular adapters, which handle collateral withdrawal, debt repayment,
     and asset supply to the target Comet market. Flash loans are validated using precomputed hashes to ensure security.
     Integrates with `SwapModule` for Uniswap V3 swaps and `ConvertModule` for DAI ⇄ USDS conversions.

Key Features:
- Modular adapter system for protocol-specific migration logic.
- Optional Uniswap V3 flash loans for liquidity management.
- Owner-controlled adapter registration and flash loan configuration.
- Supports stablecoin conversions (DAI ⇄ USDS) for USDS-based Comet markets.

Core Flow:
1. User initiates migration via `migrate()` with adapter, target Comet, migration data, and optional flash loan amount.
2. If `flashAmount > 0`, a flash loan is requested, and `uniswapV3FlashCallback()` handles repayment and migration.
3. If `flashAmount == 0`, migration is executed directly without borrowing.
4. Emits `MigrationExecuted` upon success.

Security:
- Only whitelisted adapters and configured Comet contracts are allowed.
- Flash loan callbacks are strictly validated by hash and sender address.
- Adapters must implement `IProtocolAdapter` and are executed via `delegatecall`.

Limitations:
- Assumes adapter logic is secure and performs proper token accounting.
- Assumes flash loan repayment tokens are supported by Uniswap V3 and Comet.
- Relies on external modules (`SwapModule`, `ConvertModule`) for swaps and conversions.

Warning:
- This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts._

 1. Validates that the specified adapter is registered and that the target Comet contract is configured.
 2. Ensures the provided `migrationData` is not empty.
 3. Encodes and hashes the migration context for later verification during callback execution.
 4. If `flashAmount > 0`, initiates a flash loan from the configured Uniswap V3 pool by calling its `flash()` method.

 6. If the delegatecall succeeds, emits the {MigrationExecuted} event with zero flash fee.
 7. Stores a callback hash only for the duration of the function execution to validate flash loan integrity._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |

Effects: - Stores a callback hash to validate flash loan integrity. - Either initiates a flash loan or directly calls the adapter logic depending on `flashAmount`. - Emits {MigrationExecuted} upon successful completion. Warning: - This contract does not support Fee-on-transfer tokens. Using such tokens may result in unexpected behavior or reverts. Reverts: - {InvalidMigrationData} if `migrationData.length == 0`. - {InvalidAdapter} if the adapter is not registered. - {CometIsNotSupported} if flash data for `comet` is missing. - {DelegatecallFailed} if adapter delegatecall fails and returns an error payload. |

_This function is invoked by the Uniswap V3 pool after a flash loan is issued.
It performs the following steps:
 1. Validates the callback integrity by comparing the `keccak256` hash of the provided `data`
    with the stored `_storedCallbackHash`.
 2. Decodes the migration context including the user address, adapter, comet, and migration input.
 3. Verifies that the caller is the expected Uniswap V3 pool associated with the target `comet`.
 4. Computes the repayment amount, including Uniswap's flash loan fee.
 5. Invokes the protocol adapter logic via `delegatecall`, passing the full context and encoded flash loan details.
 6. Emits the {MigrationExecuted} event if the adapter call succeeds._

Requirements: - The function must be called by the exact Uniswap V3 liquidity pool configured for the `comet`. - The hash of `data` must match `_storedCallbackHash`. - The protocol adapter must successfully execute the migration via `delegatecall`.
